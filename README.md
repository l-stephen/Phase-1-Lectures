# Communicating with External APIs

## SWBAT

- Explain what an API is
- Explain the limitations of working with an external API
- Observe how to parse API documentation
- Observe how to send a GET request to an external API with / without an API key

## Whats an API and limitations

Application interface (API) that sends information back and forth between a website or app, and a user
Some API owners will place limits on the numbers of requests or the amount of data a client can request, it is important to read the documentation of an API to know what the limit is.

## Deliverables

1. Fetch data from the dog api and display a random dog image, then append to the div with class "container", the div should have a like button that can be incremented
2. Fetch data from an external api that requires an api key, hide the api key using a .gitignore, and display the data on a div
